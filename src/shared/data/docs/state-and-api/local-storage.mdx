# Local storage

The app's Redux state may be synced with local storage.

There is a helper for getting and setting local storage data, `localStorage.js`

To sync state, add the slices of state you'd like saved to local storage to the store subscription in `src/index.js`

```
store.subscribe(() => {
  const currentState = store.getState()

  const state = {
    api: {
      currentUser: currentState.api?.currentUser
    }
  }
  saveState(state)
})
```
