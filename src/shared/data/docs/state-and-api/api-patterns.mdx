# API Patterns

Nova is built for [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) APIs. It can be modified to accommodate any data fetching technique, but there is tooling and helpers to make getting started with REST quick and easy.

###

API requests are initiated by an API model. An example can be found at `src/api/nova/Auth.js`

```
import Redux from '../redux'
import createApiAction from '../createApiAction'

const baseUrl = process.env.API_URL
const apiPath = '/auth'
const prefix = 'AUTH'
const storeKey = 'auth'

export default class Auth {
  static signUp = async ({ email, password }) => {
    const url = `${baseUrl}${apiPath}`
    const options = {
      method: 'POST',
      url,
      prefix,
      storeKey,
      payload: {
        email,
        password
      }
    }

    const action = await createApiAction(options)
    return Redux.dispatch(action)
  }
}
```

Here we can see the `signUp` method is constructing an `options` object. This object is then used to generate a special Redux action called an API action. This pattern was adapted from blog posts like [this one](https://engineering.thetrainline.com/handling-api-calls-in-redux-with-redux-api-middleware-c95c38816e13).

<br />

We then dispatch this action (following this naming convention `{PREFIX}_{METHOD}_REQUEST`) which will get picked up by our Redux middleware, `apiMiddleware.js`. This middleware only cares about actions that contain the `CALL_API` [symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol). Based on the options provided, a `fetch` request is fired. Upon completion, a second action is dispatched, either `_SUCCESS` or `_FAILURE`.

<br />

Using the `apiStatusSelector`, our components can render appropriately.
