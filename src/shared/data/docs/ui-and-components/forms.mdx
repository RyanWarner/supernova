# Forms

Form state is powered by [Informed](https://github.com/joepuzzo/informed). Informed is well maintained and straightforward way to abstract form state and allow us to focus on other things.

#### Usage

This template comes with a HOC for wrapping components in an Informed `form` called `withInformed`.

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import { withInformed } from 'app/components'

@withInformed
export default class MyForm extends Component {
  // Form elements here
}
```
