# Sentry

"[Sentry](https://sentry.io/) provides open-source and hosted error monitoring that helps all software teams discover, triage, and prioritize errors in real-time."

Sentry offers a generous free plan, Slack integrations, and this boilerplate is already configured to use Sentry.

#### Setup

1. Create a Sentry account
1. Create a Sentry project
1. Add your Sentry DSN to your environment variables. See `config/.env.development`.

#### Slack notifications

We recommend configuring an alert rule to send Slack notifications when Sentry receives an exception.
