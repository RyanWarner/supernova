# Analytics

The Analytics class provides a single API for triggering analytics events to one or more 3rd party analytics services. [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) and [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web) are configured out of the box, but can be easily removed or added to.

Analytics are initialized in `src/index.js` and configured to capture all route changes by default.

```js
// src/index.js

analytics.initialize().then(() => {
  const { pathname } = browserHistory.location
  analytics.pageView({ pathname })
})

const unlisten = browserHistory.listen((location, action) => {
  const { pathname } = location
  analytics.pageView({ pathname })
})
```

<br />

You can use the analytics class to capture custom events like clicks. See `src/analytics/analytics.js`
