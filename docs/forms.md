# Forms

Yawnch uses a fantastic library called [Informed](https://github.com/joepuzzo/informed) by Joe Puzzo as the foundation to build forms.
The boilerplate comes with some patterns and usage examples to make working with forms quick and easy.

## Creating a new form

1. Create a new component. 
  ```
    $ npx plop Component
    ? Name of your component: LoginForm
  ```

1. Add form related Higher Order Components
  ```

  ```
